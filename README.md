### How to extend

Abstracting out the extension specific details aside, it's super easy to add and remove features to this. Checkout the `init.js` file, here you can modify the colours that are used, add the one's you like or just change the existing one's. Below that you can also change the default set of quotes loaded in. The format defines authors name as a top level key and all quotes from that specific author can be added in the array under that.
